# Recipe Search App

This app was made using SwiftUI and the Spoonacular API. It serves to help people quickly find recipes for appetizers, entrees, desserts, and snacks!

## Key Features
* The app features a search bar that allows users to search recipes by ingredients or by name
* Simple design, very easy to use
* Most recipes contain photos for users to see what they are trying to make

## Challenges Faced and Future Additions
### Challenges
* It was difficult to use the API, since each task had a different URL
* I faced difficulties in getting the information and displaying them. 

### Future
* I hope that I can make the UI look prettier and easier on the eyes
* I want to make it so that users can add their own recipes to the database
* I want to add more tabs such as settings for accessability and a favorites tab
* Format the recipes so it is more fluid and easier for users to follow
